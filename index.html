        <h2 class="uppercase">Our story</h2>

        <p>We are a small family-run venture that relies purely on donations and volunteer 
            work from the amazing local community.</p>

        <p>After inheriting a large family estate, we noticed how our family dogs loved the open 
            space. Coming from the “standard” average home to live in this amazing part of the world, being able to walk our dogs with all the conform that they felt safe and were able to be free, led us to think, what about those families that felt the same way about their dogs whilst walking the cold noisy streets.</p>

        <p>We decided to trial out a day where all our friends would come over for the day with 
        their furbabies and just let them be free. Watching the our friends really have fun and 
        most importantly watching the pets really open up was the moment we realised that we could 
        offer the community something special.
        Fast forward a couple of months later we finally opened Walk Haven to the public.
        We did not expect the turnout we did and needless to say neither did the dogs coming to 
        have fun.
        The rest is just history from there.</p>

        <p>We opened the charity soon after to help run the park and offered memberships to anyone 
        who wished to be a part of the vision, we were making a reality.
        The park is purely run by our family and the amazing volunteers and is free to anyone 
        who wishes to visit. We do also welcome donations and should you want to get in touch please to go over to our Contact page and fill out the form. We do read and reply to every email we get.</p>
