## Design Choices

### Fonts
I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website.
I have mostly used **Arima Madurai** and **Roboto** for most of the site. **Roboto** will be used for the Body and **Arima Madurai** for the the logo.

### Icons
I have chosen to use the amazing icons supplied from [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons are easy to interpret and are free to use on the website

### Colours

I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "coolors") to generate a suitable palette for my colour scheme. 

I will explain the uses of the varius colours below, starting from top to bottom.

![Colour Pallet](wireframes/coolors.png)
 
 * --china-pink: #d87093;
 * --honeydew: #f1faee;
 * --beige: #f1f3e0;
 * --dutch-white: #f1e4c3;
 * --wheat: #f0dcb4;

### Structure

I have decided to use CSS Grid and Flex for creating a resposive layout over Bootstrap. I preferred CSS Grid for main drif layout and flexbox due to the flexibilty (no pun intended) in styling a "grid within a grid" layout for the webiste and to overly worry about the Specifity issue created by importing the bootstrap library.

# Wireframes

I originally created these by hand on paper which allowed me to be more productive in case i needed to change things last minute. I then transfered these to [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic") to create my wireframes for my website

The wireframes are below:

# Features

+ The main feature I think is the Gallery and the layout used.
+ One page scrolling with 3 sections making it feel as a 3 page website.
+ Contact form with video

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is fully responsive and even though it is a single page it still feels as a multiple page website. It includes links to hover pseudo elements and by limiting the links to three, makes for a relaxed and easy navigation experience.
\
&nbsp;

+ Desktop (>=771px)
\
&nbsp;
![Navigation bar](wireframes/large.png)


+ Small devices (<480px)

  - This section includes: Our Mission, Park Location and Hours
  - Image of a family bathing the beloved pet

### Contact Section

+ Simple and well styled form for General Enquiries, Volunteering and Complaints

### Footer

+ The footer will contain the links to all my social media.


## Future Features
+ I plan to continue to add more features as I learn new technologies through out the course.

# Testing

## Gallery

* I planned to have a 6 column grid large screen and 1 column on mobile screens
  * on testing the 6 column i found the images were to condensed and caused the grid to look overcrowded.
  * on the mobile screen with 1 column i found that the gallery seemed a little longer than it needed be. Asked family for their input and they agreed.
  * result was not what I found was the aim and decided to change it to a 4 column on larger screen and 2 columns on mobile.
  * There was a noticeably better user experience on the molibe view as i was able to position larger height images along each other which allowed for a shorter yet more user friendly experience.
  * I chosen to use a masonary type of layout that is fully responsive to any screen size.
  \
&nbsp;
* After adding the images, and getting the correct layout, I noticed thats the load times of the site were too slow.
  * The sizes of the images were on average 3mb each.
  * I decided to compress the images with a site called [iloveimg](https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image#resize-options,percentage "iloveimg"). Images were able to be reduced by 88% without it affectibg the quality of the images.

 ## Form

* 

* Also when the site was three separate pages it would load the gallery really slowly which made for a unpleasant user experience. Changing it to one scrolling page made it a lot better to navigate.

+ I wanted to incorporate a modal for a contact form instead of a embebed form on the page. When trying to style it it would cause issues when in small viewports. As it was a CSS only modal i decided to wait for further learning and possibl add the feature in version 2 of the site.

+ W3 HTML Validation
![W3 HTML Validation](wireframes/w3validatorcheck.png)

+ W3 CSS Validation
![W3 CSS Validation](wireframes/w3cssvalidation.png)

## Unfixed Bugs

+ Issue with form overflow on extremely small displays at <250px. Also some of the margins in the different screens sizes have been difficult to get working 100% the way I wanted. Unless pointed out it should not affect the overall UX.


# Deployment
