## Design Choices

### Fonts
I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website.
I have mostly used "Arima Madurai" and "Roboto" for most of the site. "Robot" will be used for the Body and "Arima Madurai" for the the logo.

### Icons
I have chosen to use the amazing icons supplied from [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons are easy to interpret and are free to use on the website

### Colours

I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "coolors") to generate a suitable palette for my colour scheme. 

I will explain the uses of the varius colours below, starting from top to bottom.

![Colour Pallet](wireframes/coolors.png)
 
 * --china-pink: #d87093;
 * --honeydew: #f1faee;
 * --beige: #f1f3e0;
 * --dutch-white: #f1e4c3;
 * --wheat: #f0dcb4;

### Structure

I have decided to use CSS Grid and Flex for creating a resposive layout over Bootstrap. I preferred CSS Grid for main drif layout and flexbox due to the flexibilty (no pun intended) in styling a "grid in a grid" layout for the webiste and to overly worry about the Specifity issue created by importing the bootstrap library.

# Wireframes

I originally created these by hand on paper which allowed me to be more productive in case i needed to change things last minute. I then transfered these to [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic") to create my wireframes for my website

The wireframes are below:

# Features

+ The main feature I think is the Gallery and the layout used.
+ One page scrolling with 3 sections making it feel as a 3 page website.
+ Contact form with video

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is fully responsive and even though it is a single page it still feels as a multiple page website. It includes links to hover pseudo elements and by limiting the links to three, makes for a relaxed and easy navigation experience.

+ Desktop (>=771px)

# Testing

* on testing the stie I found the images really slowed the site down. I used a site called
[iloveimg](https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image#resize-options,percentage "iloveimg") to compress the files sizes for better rendering on loading the page.

* Also when the site was three separate pages it would load the gallery really slowly which made for a unpleasant user experience. Changing it to one scrolling page made it a lot better to navigate.

+ I wanted to incorporate a modal for a contact form instead of a embebed form on the page. When trying to style it it would cause issues when in small viewports. As it was a CSS only modal i decided to wait for further learning and possibl add the feature in version 2 of the site.

+ W3 HTMl Validation
![W3 HTML Validation](wireframes/W3validatorcheck.png)

+ W3 CSS Validation
![W3 CSS Validation](wireframes/w3CSSvalidation.png)

## Unfixed Bugs

+ Issue with form overflow on extremely small displays at <150px. Also some of th pading in the different screens sizes have difficult to get working 100% the way i wanted. Unless pointed out it should not affect the overall UX.


# Deployment

This project is deployed by using Github.
+ After coding and style the site, I used the Github pages to generate the URL - https://daferia.github.io/walk-haven-scroll/
