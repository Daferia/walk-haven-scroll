## Design Choices

### Fonts
I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website.
I have mostly used "Arima Madurai" and "Roboto" for most of the site. "Robot" will be used for the Body and "Arima Madurai" for the the logo.

### Icons
I have chosen to use the amazing icons supplied from [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These logos are easy to interpret and are free to use on the website

### Colours
I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "coolors") to generate a suitable palette for my colour scheme. 


I will explain the uses of the varius colours below, starting from top to bottom.


![Colour Pallet](wireframes/coolors.png)


 
 * --china-pink: #d87093;
 * --honeydew: #f1faee;
 * --beige: #f1f3e0;
 * --dutch-white: #f1e4c3;
 * --wheat: #f0dcb4;

### Structure

I have decided to use CSS Grid and Flex for creating a resposive layout over Bootstrap. I preferred CSS Grid for main drif layout and flexbox due to the flexibilty (no pun intended) in styling a "grid in a grid" layout for the webiste and to overly worry about the Specifity issue created by importing the bootstrap library.

# Wireframes
I originally created these by hand on paper which allowed me to be more productive in case i needed to change things last minute. I then transfered these to [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic") to create my wireframes for my website

The wireframes are below:


### [Desktop Wireframe]( "Desktop wireframe")
### [Tablet Wireframe]( "Tablet wireframe")
### [Phone Wireframe]( "Phone wireframe")

# Features
The main feature I think is the Gallery and the layout used.

## Future Features
I plan to continue to add more features as I learn new technologies through out the course.
I plan to add a Google Maps API so that the End user can easily navigate to the park at a click of a button.

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is fully responsive and even though it is a single page it still feels as a multiple page website. It includes links to hover pseudo elements and by limiting the links to three, makes for a relaxed and easy navigation experience.

+ Desktop (>=992px)

+ Small devices (<992px)

# Testing
* on testing the stie I found the images really slowed the site down. I used a site called
[iloveimg](https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image#resize-options,percentage "iloveimg") to compress the files sizes for better rendering on load.
